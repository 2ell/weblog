<p>It is such an ongoing challenge to describe oneself in an about page as I rarely feel anything <i>about me</i> is lasting, including the very breath of oxygen I am taking somewhere at this exact moment. I absolutely adore the <a href="https://laurel.omg.lol/now">now page</a> movement and encourage you to not only check out mine but also <i>create your own</i>.</p>
