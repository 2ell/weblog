<p>Plant-lovin' visionary type. Literary artist. YIMBY. <a rel="me" href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>/PKM hobbyist & tinkerer. Dedicated, weather-resistant pedestrian (<i>car-free in YYC since '93</i>). Answers promptly to the call of the afternoon daydream, the whistle of the tea kettle, or - sometimes - the name Laurel.</p>

<p>It is such an ongoing challenge to describe oneself in an about page as I rarely feel anything <i>about me</i> is lasting, including the very breath of oxygen I am taking somewhere at this exact moment. I absolutely adore the <a href="https://laurel.omg.lol/now">now page</a> movement and encourage you to not only check out mine but also *create your own*.</p>
